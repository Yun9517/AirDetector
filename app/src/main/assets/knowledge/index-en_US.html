					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are organic chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at ordinary room temperature. Their
						high vapor pressure results from a low boiling point, which causes large numbers of molecules to evaporate or sublimate from
						the liquid or solid form of the compound and enter the surrounding air, a trait known as volatility. For example, formaldehyde,
						which evaporates from paint and releases from materials like quartz, has a boiling point of only –19 °C (–2 °F).</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Most scents or
						odors are of VOCs. VOCs play an important role in communication between plants,[1] and messages from plants to animals. Some
						VOCs are dangerous to human health or cause harm to the environment. Anthropogenic VOCs are regulated by law, especially
						indoors, where concentrations are the highest. Harmful VOCs typically are not acutely toxic, but have compounding long-term
						health effects. Because the concentrations are usually low and the symptoms slow to develop, research into VOCs and their
						effects is difficult. Parts Per Billion(PPB) as standard measure unit.</p>

					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diverse definitions of the term VOC are in use.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definitions of VOCs used for control of precursors of photochemical smog used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies in the US with independent outdoor air pollution regulations include exemptions for VOCs that are determined to be non-reactive, or of low-reactivity in the smog formation process.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, regulatory requirements for VOCs vary among the states. Most prominent is the VOC regulation issued by the South Coast Air Quality Management District in California and by the California Air Resources Board (ARB).</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this specific use of the term VOCs can be misleading, especially when applied to indoor air quality because many chemicals that are not regulated as outdoor air pollution can still be important for indoor air pollution.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California's ARB uses the term "reactive organic gases" (ROG) to measure organic gases after public hearing in September 1995. The ARB revised the definition of "Volatile Organic Compounds" used in the consumer products regulations, based on their committee's findings.</p>

					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respiratory, allergic, or immune effects in infants or children are associated with man-made VOCs and other indoor or outdoor
						air pollutants.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some VOCs, such as styrene and limonene, can react with nitrogen oxides or with ozone to produce new oxidation products and secondary aerosols, which can cause sensory irritation symptoms.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspecified VOCs are important in the creation of smog.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health effects include eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches, loss of coordination, nausea; and damage to the liver, kidney, and central nervous system.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some organics can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key signs or symptoms associated with exposure to VOCs include conjunctive irritation, nose and throat discomfort, headache, allergic skin reaction, dyspnea, declines in serum cholinesterase levels, nausea, vomiting, nose bleeding, fatigue, dizziness.[citation needed] The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effects. As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics.
						At present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes.</br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans.</p>

					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to German Federal Environmental Agency's report, we can define different levels and exposure Limit time.</br>
							TVOC Range (Levels / Exposure time)</br>
							TVOC>=20000 ppb: Extreme pollution</br>
							TVOC>=5500 ppb (<20000): Serious pollution</br>
							TVOC>=2200 ppb (<5500): High pollution / hours</br>
							TVOC>=660 ppb (<2200): Medium pollution / <1 month</br>
							TVOC>=220 ppb (<660): Mild pollution / <12 months</br>
							TVOC<220 ppb : Normal / No limit</br>

					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our CO2 equivalent value is derived from our sensor measurement. Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is a colorless gas with a density about 60% higher than that of dry air. Carbon dioxide consists of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide is odorless at normally encountered concentrations, however, at high concentrations, it has a sharp and acidic odor.</br>

					<label for="ac-6">Where does indoor CO2 come from?</label>
					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carbon dioxide (CO2) is relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. </br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 400 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. </br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity. </br>
