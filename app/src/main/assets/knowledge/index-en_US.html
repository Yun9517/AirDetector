					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are organic chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at ordinary room temperature. Their
						high vapor pressure results from a low boiling point, which causes large numbers of molecules to evaporate or sublimate from
						the liquid or solid form of the compound and enter the surrounding air, a trait known as volatility. For example, formaldehyde,
						which evaporates from paint and releases from materials like quartz, has a boiling point of only –19 °C (–2 °F).</br>
						VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Most scents or
						odors are of VOCs. VOCs play an important role in communication between plants,[1] and messages from plants to animals. Some
						VOCs are dangerous to human health or cause harm to the environment. Anthropogenic VOCs are regulated by law, especially
						indoors, where concentrations are the highest. Harmful VOCs typically are not acutely toxic, but have compounding long-term
						health effects. Because the concentrations are usually low and the symptoms slow to develop, research into VOCs and their
						effects is difficult. Parts Per Billion(PPB) as standard measure unit.</p>

					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p>Diverse definitions of the term VOC are in use.</br> 
						The definitions of VOCs used for control of precursors of photochemical smog used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies in the US with independent outdoor air pollution regulations include exemptions for VOCs that are determined to be non-reactive, or of low-reactivity in the smog formation process.</br>
						In the US, regulatory requirements for VOCs vary among the states. Most prominent is the VOC regulation issued by the South Coast Air Quality Management District in California and by the California Air Resources Board (ARB).</br>
						However, this specific use of the term VOCs can be misleading, especially when applied to indoor air quality because many chemicals that are not regulated as outdoor air pollution can still be important for indoor air pollution.</br>
						California's ARB uses the term "reactive organic gases" (ROG) to measure organic gases after public hearing in September 1995. The ARB revised the definition of "Volatile Organic Compounds" used in the consumer products regulations, based on their committee's findings.</p>

					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p>Respiratory, allergic, or immune effects in infants or children are associated with man-made VOCs and other indoor or outdoor
						air pollutants.</br>
						Some VOCs, such as styrene and limonene, can react with nitrogen oxides or with ozone to produce new oxidation products and secondary aerosols, which can cause sensory irritation symptoms.</br>
						Unspecified VOCs are important in the creation of smog.</br>
						Health effects include eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches, loss of coordination, nausea; and damage to the liver, kidney, and central nervous system.</br>
						Some organics can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans.</br>
						Key signs or symptoms associated with exposure to VOCs include conjunctive irritation, nose and throat discomfort, headache, allergic skin reaction, dyspnea, declines in serum cholinesterase levels, nausea, vomiting, nose bleeding, fatigue, dizziness.[citation needed] The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effects. As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed.</br>
						Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics.
						At present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes.</br>
						Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans.</p>

					<article class="ac-auto">
						<p>Relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at a given temperature.</br>
						In weather forecast, it tells the chance of rain, foggy, etc.</br>
						Human feels hotter in high relative humidity because perspiration evaporates from the skin is slower than normal condition, also can create discomfort, mold, dust mites, skin allergies.</br>
						It's too dry in low humidity. It causes thirsty and allergies, don't forget get some water.</p>
